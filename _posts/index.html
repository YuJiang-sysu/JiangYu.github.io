          <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
          <p>Tongwen Li, Associate Professor at School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, Sun Yat - Sen University.</p>
          <p>He primarily engages in mechanism - data integrated driven atmospheric environmental remote sensing research,
            specifically manifested in three aspects: (1) systematically proposing the principles and methods of
            geographically and temporally weighted machine learning models for atmospheric environmental remote sensing,
            (2) developing atmospheric remote sensing methods that couple physicochemical mechanisms and machine learning,
            and (3) establishing spatiotemporally seamless reconstruction models for atmospheric parameters through
            multi - source data fusion.</p>
          <p>He has published more than 40 SCI papers in <i>npj CAS, GRL, RSE, ISPRS P&RS, IEEE TGRS, GMD</i>, and other
            famous journals. All papers were cited for >3900 times, among which 8 papers were cited for >100 times
            (Google Scholar); 5 papers were selected into the ESI highly cited database (one was ESI hot paper).</p>
          <p>He was listed in the World's Top 2% Scientists of Stanford University for two consecutive years (2023 and
            2024). He was awarded the First Prize of the Geographic Information Science and Technology Progress Award. His
            paper was selected as one of the "China's Top 100 Most Influential International Academic Papers", and as
            "Top Downloaded Paper 2018 - 2019" of <i>Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres</i>.</p>
